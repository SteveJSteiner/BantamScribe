# BantamScribe
1000 words. 15 minutes.

BantamScribe provides a focused word sprint making it impossible to edit as you go.

When run, the entire screen will blank. The last letter typed appears centered, and a green progress bar counts words written up to 1000. A red progress bar counts up to 15 minutes.  Hit ESC to exit. Everything you typed is ready to be pasted into your favorite editor.

Don't bother hitting delete or backspace. Those keys do nothing: continue typing or exit.

## Remember: The ESC key is the only way to exit!

Micro FAQ:

* What if I don't finish in 15 minutes? 
    - The red bar stops progressing. You've lost nothing beyond the joy of beating the timer.

* What if I type more than 1000 words? 
    - All the words you type are captured, and ready to be pasted into an editor after hitting ESC.

* What if my computer dies? 
    - Then you lost 15 minutes of work. Nothing is saved to disk until you save it in some other program.
